# NextCLoud with MariaDB/MySQL
#
# Access via "http://localhost:80" (or "http://$(docker-machine ip):8001" if using docker-machine)
#
# During initial NextCLoud setup, select "Storage & database" --> "Configure the database" --> "MySQL/MariaDB"
# Database user: nextcloud
# Database password: nextcloud
# Database name: nextcloud
# Database host: replace "localhost" with "mariadb" the same name as the data base container name.
#
#
# The reason for the more refined data persistence in the volumes is because if you were to
# use just the the '/var/www/html' then everytime you would want/need to update/upgrade
# NextCloud you would have to go into the volume on the host machine and delete 'version.php'
